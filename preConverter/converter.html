      <h3 class="noselect">Evolution of keyboards</h3>
      <p>
        Keyboards and typing technology have come a long way over the past couple centuries. The first typing devices were designed and patented in the 1700s while the first manufactured typing devices came about in the 1870s.
        Since then, we have seen several updates in design, layout, technology, and function that are more efficient and user-friendly.

        While typewriters were widely used throughout the 1950s to the 1970s, computers were starting to emerge as a consumer friendly product, beginning the age of the computer keyboard as a primary input device.
        By the late 1970s all computers used VDT and electric keyboards. It was simply the most straight-forward and user-friendly method of interacting with computers.
        The first keyboards that were sold in the 1970s were all built from scratch, piece by piece, and were heavy as they were fully mechanical.
        In the late 1970s Apple, Radio Shack and Commodore all had the foresight to see the large market in computer keyboards, and started manufacturing keyboards for their computers, paving the way for the modern assumption that all computers come with a keyboard, and that keyboards are the primary, standard input device.

        In 1986, IBM pc came equipped with the Model M keyboard.The Model M was a mechanical keyboard, and used the highest quality construction, giving typists the satisfaction of tactile feedback, acute accuracy and comfort.
        In the 1990s membrane switches began to replace the mechanical key switch, as it was quieter, weighed less, and suited the needs of the new laptop generation.
        Keyboards come in all shapes, sizes, and colors these days, though it’s important to remember that without the original, simple,  powerhouse mechanical keyboards of IBM we wouldn’t be where we are today.

      <h3 class="noselect">Evolution of Keyboard layouts</h3>
      <h4 class="noselect"><strong><a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY" target="_blank">QWERTY layout</a></strong></h4>
      <div id="main-heading">

      </div>
      <p>
        The most widely used keyboard layout is QWERTY, named as such for the positioning of the keys in the top left row. Christopher Latham Sholes and Carlos Glidden produced the first typewriter featuring the QWERTY layout in 1874 and though there have been minor changes over the past centuries, for the most part it has remained consistent.
        QWERTY layouts were developed as a means to slow typists down. In the beginning stages of the typewriter, people typed so quickly, that they often jammed the keys as they flew up to hit the typewriter ribbon. To prevent this, QWERTY was born to decrease typing efficiency and speed.
        With those inconvenient placements, more than 50% of keystrokes take place on the top row, and roughly 30% take place on the bottom row. That means that less than 20% of all keystrokes actually occur where your fingers are centrally placed, the row commonly referred to as “home row.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When IBM and the other major manufacturers chose to stick with QWERTY, everyone else followed their lead. Thus they established the standard in layout design for decades to come- regardless of how inefficient and outdated.
      </p>
      <h4 class="noselect"><strong><a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout" target="_blank">Dvorak layout</a></strong></h4>
      <div id="main-heading">

      </div>
      <p>
        The QWERTY model keyboard is still used today by some of the world’s fastest typists, but imagine how much faster and more efficient typing could be if the keys we use most often were under the strongest of our fingers in the easiest to access areas. That’s where Dvorak comes in. The Dvorak simplified layout was introduced in 1936 by Dr. August Dvorak, and offers a keyboard layout that is more intuitive and efficient for modern typists.
        On a Dvorak keyboard, all of the most commonly used characters fall under the home row. He placed the vowels: A, O, E, U and I under the left hand and the letters: D, H, T, N and S under the right hand.

      <h4 class="noselect"><strong><a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak#:~:text=Colemak%20is%20a%20keyboard%20layout,after%20its%20inventor%2C%20Shai%20Coleman." target="_blank">Colemak layout</a></strong></h4>
      <div id="main-heading">
        <img src="../images/colemak.png" width=50%/>
      </div>
      <p>
        The third most popular keyboard layout after QWERTY, then Dvorak, is the Colemak layout.
        Because only 17 keys differ from the QWERTY layout, this keyboard layout is fairly easy to relearn after years of QWERTY use.
        This has helped the Colemak layout to gain a following amongst typists who no longer want to adhere to an outdated QWERTY mode of typing, but are frustrated with the learning curve involved in readjusting to the Dvorak layout.
        Another interesting thing in colemak is, it modified the most unused key Capslock to Backspace by default.
